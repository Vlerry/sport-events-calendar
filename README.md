# Sport events calendar

## Introduction
MVP of a single page app to view or add new sports events.


## Technologies

For building this application it was used:
 - HTML5;
 - CSS3;
 - JavaScript, ES6.

## Description

Was used the latest features of ECMA Script, some latest features of HTML language specifications and CSS variable for creating a theme, easy mentainance and scalability. 
The project functionality was splitted in separated folders and files for a better maintenance and reusability, for example:
- used a separated file for aka state management, for futher replacement of a third party state management, 
- splitted CSS styles in multiple chunks, allows to easy access and replace varriables, 
- separated the templates code from JS main file, that makes the project more easy to read and develop.
Used Dialog native, for displaying a form overlay, which provides usability and accessibility features that must be replicated if using other elements for a similar purpose.
Made the project responsive on big screens, laptop, tablet and mobile.



## Inprovements

1. Use TypeScript to extend JavaScript and to improve the developer experience. TypeScript enables developers to add type safety to their projects. Moreover, it provides various other features, like interfaces, type aliases, abstract classes, function overloading, tuple, generics, etc.;
2. Implement it with a help of library or framework like (Nextjs, Angular, Vue);
3. Use a CSS preprocessor (SASS, module CSS, styled components, etc.);
4. State management (depending on framework/library).
